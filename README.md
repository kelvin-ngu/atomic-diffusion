## Project: 2D Atomic Diffusion Model Simulation

### Description
This MATLAB project simulates the displacement of a particle on a 2D lattice under the influence of an electric field and varying temperatures. The simulation calculates how different electric field strengths and temperatures affect the particle's displacement. This is a Monte Carlo Simulation.

### Results
The code generates five plots for each electric field strength:
1. Mean x-displacement vs. Temperature
2. Mean y-displacement vs. Temperature
3. Mean total displacement vs. Temperature
4. RMS of total displacement vs. Temperature
5. Standard deviation of total displacement vs. Temperature

### Usage
1. **Run the MATLAB Script**: Execute the provided script to perform the simulation.
2. **View Results**: Plots will be generated showing how displacement statistics vary with temperature for different electric field strengths.

### Requirements
- MATLAB (R2021b or later recommended)
